# Deep mutational scanning of ABC transporter

Deep mutational scanning of ABC transporter is a software tool for processing and analyzing sequence alignment files from deep mutational scanning experiments of ABC transporters using paired overlap sequences.

## Notes
This repo is a fork of [Gianmarco's original code](https://github.com/giameier/DMS_ABC), I am adapting the code to be run as a part of the [DMS-pipeline nextflow pipeline](https://github.com/fabianackle/DMS-pipeline).
